# Deep-Learning
1. [CNN-LSTM model on DNA sequence](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Deep-Learning/tree/main/CNN-LSTM%20DNA%20sequence)
   - Hybrid CNN and bidirectional LSTM RNN structure to predict DNA sequences to binary output
   - Achieved 94% test accuracy
2. [Multimodal-MARS: Variational autoencoder based models for single cell annotation](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Multimodal-MARS)
   - Incorporated VAE and CVAE models into MARS-single cell autoencoder based model (Brbic et al. 2020)
   - Achieved improved modality integration between single cell RNA and ATAC seq data
   - Enhanced label transfering from single cell RNA to highly sparsed ATAC seq data
   - Achieved better clustering boundaries than AE based MARS for multi-modal single cell annotation
3. [GRU-based multi head model to predict microbe-host and microbe-microbe interactions](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Autoregressive_microbe.ipynb)
   - Achieved multi-tasking classification of host disease state
   - Achieved autoregressive time seires prediction of microbial relative abundance at different taxonomy levels
