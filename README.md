# Deep-Learning
1. Deep learning on DNA sequences
   - Hybrid CNN and bidirectional LSTM RNN structure to predict DNA sequences to binary output
   - Achieve 94% test accuracy
2. Variational autoencoder based models for single cell annotation 
   - Incorporate VAE and CVAE models into MARS-single cell autoencoder based model (Brbic et al. 2020)
   - Achieve multi-modality cell type naming
   - Achieve better clustering boundaries than AE based MARS for multi-modal single cell annotation
